The python version of the figures for [Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory) are generated using the [Econ-ARK/HARK](http://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) toolkit.

To generate the figures yourself, you can:

1. Launch an interactive [Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/REMARK/master?filepath=REMARKs%2FBufferStockTheory%2FBufferStockTheory.ipynb) using [mybinder](https://mybinder.org) 
   * Creates a virtual machine that will run the ipython code in your browser
   * Warning: It may take a few minutes to launch the VM
   
or install the tools to do everything locally on your own computer:

1. Install the Econ-ARK toolkit per the README.md [instructions on the GitHub site](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) 
   1. At the command line, go to the right directory and type `ipython BufferStockTheory.py`; or
   1. Run it in an interactive [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) locally
      1. Install the tool for running a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)
	  1. Launch a jupyter notebook instance (`jupyter notebok` from the command line)
	  1. Open BufferStockTheory.ipynb, and click the double-triangle icon to run everything
